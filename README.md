# C# Tutorial – Move Multiple images in Windows Form using Mouse Drag and Drop

In the previous tutorial we have explored how to drag and drop a single image inside of windows form. In this tutorial we will explore how to move multiple objects by first drawing them on the screen using the paint event, linking the rectangles and images together and finally registering their movements with the mouse events. This one will be a fun tutorial for you to follow because you can pretty much make this the bases of some card games perhaps where you can battle between other cards, make a table top game or even use this as a GUI example in windows form. We will be using OOP programming to make this application. So if you are after a simple example of how to use OOP in a C# Project then please check out the video below and it will be explained to you step by step. Make sure you download the images from the link below before starting on the tutorial.
